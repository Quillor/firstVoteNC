				<p class="alert-desc"> First Vote NC, with the help of Carolina K-12, NCDPI and EdNC launched a civic engagement curriculum and election simulation platform in conjunction with the 2016 elections for NC public and charter high schools.  More than 32,000 students voted in 46 counties in the state. 

				While the national elections may get the most attention, we can’t forget that American democracy requires active engagement every year. That’s why First Vote, with the help of our partners, has designed a package for local elections with an expanded curriculum and enhanced online voter platform. 

				Local elections provide the perfect opportunity for teachers to make students aware of issues happening in their own communities. 

				If students have an opportunity to practice voting every year, voting becomes a habit. Let’s make North Carolina a leader in cultivating civically engaged and informed young people.

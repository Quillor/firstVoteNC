				<strong>Enrollment for this free service will be available in August</strong>
			</div>		
				<p class="alert-desc"> First Vote NC, with the help of Carolina K-12, NCDPI and EdNC launched a civic engagement curriculum and election simulation platform in conjunction with the 2016 elections for NC public and charter high schools.  More than 32,000 students voted in 46 counties in the state. 

				While the national elections may get the most attention, we can’t forget that American democracy requires active engagement every year. That’s why First Vote, with the help of our partners, has designed a package for local elections with an expanded curriculum and enhanced online voter platform. 

				Local elections provide the perfect opportunity for teachers to make students aware of issues happening in their own communities. 

				If students have an opportunity to practice voting every year, voting becomes a habit. Let’s make North Carolina a leader in cultivating civically engaged and informed young people.

							<p>The best part was the way that First Vote was able to tap into a population base that was apathetic and ignorant of the voting process.

							<p>I loved this initiative and the real-world application. I wish we could find a way touse these ideas even when there is not a presidential election. Would it be possible to include state and local elections every year?</p>
